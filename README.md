# Rhythmthief2012.github.io

Hi! My name is Nicole, and I'm trying to restore as much of the 2012 Rhythm Thief website as I can.
I've implemented every Flash that was held on the site, I have pages for the Web Demo (although broken for the time being due to Github's upload size limit) and I'm going to add the (removed) News section soon!
